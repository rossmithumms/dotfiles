# NOTE HISTORY
# 2018-12-16

## INSTALLS
 - [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
   - [Tabular](https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular)
   - [Vim Markdown](https://github.com/gabrielelana/vim-markdown)
   - [Vim Markdown, Plasticboy](https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown) 

## NOTES
 - Getting more serious about using tmux and vim to structure my workflow today!
 - Needed the break to be selfish and compute **my wayyy~**
 - OK, Tabular looks gorgeous.  Vundle and Tabular are both installed now; :Tab/| should align:

## TABULAR TEST
| My        | name    | is    | mud     |
| My        | friends | don't | care    |
| When      | I       | go    | without |
| Underwear |
 
## MARKDOWN TEST
 - I'm less impressed with gabrielelana's vim-markdown highlighter; plasticboy seems to have
   a more subscribed one.
 - ... Switching in vundle...
 - So far the plasticboy version looks great.  I am just struggling with `C-i cr` for opening a newline versus just `o`.  I found a key mapping to jump to start or end of line while in insert mode, going to try that out now.
 - Perfect!  Adding new entries to this file is as simple as `G i C-e cr`. ... That must look insane to anyone who may read this.  Oh well.

## INSTALLS
 - ~/.vimrc/syntax highlighting

## KPMP-530
 - Had to clean house on `kpmp-dvc2`; purged a bunch of old kernel update versions in `/boot` so I could install `zip` and upload to delphinus-dev
 - Transferred to dev.  Testing locally...
 - Wow, testing locally ended up being a pain.  I had to re-create the patients.json collection, generate UUIDs for each WSI, and all the format-munging involved.
 - This is exactly the kind of process that is tedious to do manually, tedious to script, but once scripted is magically automatic.  We need to get there badly.
 - Cleaning up my intermediate work in wsi-pipeline now...
 - Aaand done

## KPMP-554, Started
 - Venn Diagram component timebox
 - 30m spent on reviewing D3 concepts, layout implementations (see today's reading)
 - Looks like a combination of the venn.js library for layout and the built-in histogram component will serve our needs for the Atlas v0.01

## KPMP-545, Done
 - Create project repo with empty web project
 - Done

## KPMP-546, Done
 - Create a minimal docker-compose for the project
 - Done

## KPMP-546, Done
 - Create minimal docker-compose in heavens-docker for microscopium
 - Done

## KPMP-547, Done
 - Create a minimal nephron page
 - Done

## KPMP-548, Done
 - Create a minimal dataviz page
 - Done

## KPMP-549, Started
 - Implement state with redux to retain information on navigation
 - Putting down until I have better digested Raji data for state model

# 2018-12-18

## KPMP-549, Hold
 - Redux state navigation between schematic and dataviz pages

## KPMP-551, Almost Done
 - Parse the Raji data to something usable
 - EOD 12/18, a working wsi-worker repository is generating usable JSON!
 - All I'm missing is the set generation function - doing that now.

### MICROSCOPIUM-WORKER
 - [json-simple](https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/downloads)
 - There are many genes to many clusters.
 - Per gene and per cluster there are 1 pVal and 1 avgLogFc.
 - Data interrogation goals
   - Make it easy to show agreement and disagreement
     - Which genes are in which cells according to each TIS
   - Make it easy to see where we guessed on associations
     - Cell types to nephron schematic structures
   - Make it easy to see where we did not guess
     - Cell types that did not fit nephron schematic structures

### MICROSCOPIUM DATA MODEL
#### SCHEMATIC MAP (READ)
|InVision Structure|InVision Cell Type|Schema Cell Type|UMICH Cluster Name|UCDSF Cluster Name|UCSD Cluster Name|Meta|

#### GENE TO CELL MAP, PER TIS (READ)
|Gene|PValAdj|AvgLogFc|Cell|

#### CELL TO GENE MAP (GEN)
 - Index: Invision Cell Type
 - Contents: array of unique Gene Names with their p values by TIS

#### GENE TO CELL MAP (GEN)
 - Index: Gene Name
 - Contents: array of unique Invision Cell Types with their p values by TIS

### MICROSCOPIUM GRAPHING STRATEGY
#### VENN DIAGRAM
 - Given an Invision Cell Type, retrieve contents from Cell to Gene Map
 - With each gene, iterate to count by each set and intersection, yielding this data structure below.

{
  cells: {
    InVisionCellType1: {
      sets: [
        { sets: ['UMICH SC'], size: 100 },
        { sets: ['USCD SN'], size: 100 },
        { sets: ['UCSF SC'], size: 100 },
        { sets: ['UMICH SC', 'USCD SN'], size: 100 },
        { sets: ['UMICH SC', 'UCSF SC'], size: 100 },
        { sets: ['USCD SN', 'UCSF SC'], size: 100 },
        { sets: ['UMICH SC', 'UCSF SN', 'UCSF SC', size: 100] }
      ],
      rows: {
        Gene1: { gene: 'Gene1', cVal: 8.2, 'UMICH SC': 0.01, 'UCSF SC': 0.005, 'USCD SN': false },
        Gene2: { gene: 'Gene2', cVal: 8.2, 'UMICH SC': 0.01, 'UCSF SC': 0.005, 'USCD SN': false },
	Gene3: { ... }
	}
    },
    InVisionCellType2: { ... }
  },

  genes: {
    Gene1: {
      rows: [
        { cell: 'InVisionCellType1', 'UMICH SC': 0.01, 'UCSF SC': 0.005, 'USCD SN': false  },
        { cell: 'InVisionCellType2', 'UMICH SC': 0.01, 'UCSF SC': 0.005, 'USCD SN': false  },
	{ ... }
      ]
    }
  }
}

# 2018-12-19
## KPMP-551, Done
 - Writing Venn.js set generators in microscopium-woker...
 - Took a bit more down and dirty lodash than I anticipated but it is now done

## KPMP-550, Done
 - Generate JSON mapping the structures to cell types
 - Creating mapping...
 - Created!

## KPMP-549, Done
 - Adding linkage from schematic page to datavzi page.
 - This is tricky, as it involves implementing all my actions, reducers, and containers for redux to behave.
 - Most of the way there already...  I have toggleable state working, but not rendering on the page...
 - ... Aaand done. Redux fully implemented to the extent I should need.  State is now passing cell selection and site selections.

## KPMP-563, Started
 - Implement data table for selected cell genes
 - The JSON should be drop-in good behavior...  Testing out now with super minimal react table...
 - ... Minimal react table sort method implemented, columns implemented - works out of the box.  Gorgeous.  Still a few more decoration features and above-the-fold sizing to do.

# 2018-12-20

## KPMP-563, On Hold
 - Starting KPMP-562 to ensure basic Venn is in place before refining table features

## KPMP-562, Started
 - Adding Venn.js dependency and a dirt simple on-screen version with data...
 - ... Adding propTypes validation for selectedSets and selectedSites ...
 - ... Minimal implementation is coded but I cannot test.  D3 versions are not clearly in evidence.
 - Going to pin my D3 version to the last version of 4, which I think is the last version supported by Venn.js.
 - [D3 Version History](https://github.com/d3/d3/releases?after=v5.0.0)
 - D3 version 4.10.0 seems to match the Venn.js version, at first blush, if I'm reading the Venn.js commit history and script tags correctly.

# 2018-12-21

## KPMP-562, On Hold
 - More to do in cleaning this venn up / make it interactive, but I'm now pivoting toward deployment-related tasks.
 - But first!  Data!

## KPMP-595, Done
 - Regenerating atlas.json with new CSV data...
 - ... Regenerated.  Merged into microscopium-web, validated, and merged into develop on that project.
 - ... Merged develop into venn branch KPMP-562.

# 2018-12-22

## KPMP-598, Done
 - Integrate microscopium-web into heavens-docker using subdirectory strategy shown in delphinus-web
 - ... Updated base path configs in microscopium-web; only really needed to set the homepage in package.json
 - HashRouter doesn't need a base path or it adds redundant "atlas" path fragments in the URL
 - Also had to update the delphinus docker-compose to point correctly to the build folder for microscopium; PR submitted
 - Calling this ticket done

## KPMP-562, Done
 - Having problems importing components after changing base path scheme with KPMP-598. Researching why imports are missing...
 - ... Component rendering woes have been resolved.  Don't remember exactly how I did it.
 - Updated styling on the site selectors, added legend colors to match venn diagram, updated readability of font labels on venn...
 - ... Did not make venn hoverable/interactive at all.  Dropping that from scope for time being as we have no clear requirements.
 - Data clearly needs to be revisited; venn set totals are not being calculated correctly at all.  Defect card has already been opened.

## KPMP-563, Done
 - Added missing table columns and headers
 - Relaid out the grid on the dataviz screen to be closer to comps
 - Calling the table feature "done" barring cosmetic issues

## KPMP-556, Started
 - This is technically a timebox for making the nephron hover component behave, but I'm going to use it to lay out the nephron page first
 - ... Fleshed out a lot of the missing UI elements that make the atlas look similar to the DPR

# 2018-12-23

## KPMP-556, Done
 - I have some scratch/skunk assets to dummy up the component logic of the nephron hover stuff
 - I will now determine how to appropriately map these in JSON
 - With further thought, I will take the following strategy:
   - Under every object with hoverable image contents, store an array of Strings named images
   - Each image in the array corresponds to a CSS class defined in index.scss that specifies all style properties (left, top, bg image, etc)
   - Expected behavior is that on-hover of the generated on-screen element, those images will transition on and others will hide
   - When rendering the component for the first time and preparing the DOM, we will use [_.union](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#union) iteratively to build a list of the images to be appended to the image hover container
 - ONE MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE: structures will gain a "cell" property, indicating the cell they correspond to when they are clicked.

# 2018-12-24

## KPMP-560, On Hold
 - Schematic JSON and component page updated with new structure for images
 - ... Implemented CSS rules to match JSON components
 - ... Implemented image asset pre-loading based on image names from schematic
 - ... Implemented non-optimized graphics for all available schematic images (a few are missing: t-cells, arteriole, peritubular-capillary
 - ... Implemented onMouseEnter events to reveal assets with simple toggle
 - !!! I removed the cell label names from the diagram because they would be horribly aliased in a web browser; I need to recreate those labels
 - Stopping for now so I can deploy to qa-demo

DONE FOR TODAY!

# 2019-01-02

## JIRA CARD REVIEW

## KPMP-596, Done
 - Fixed the venn counting by ripping and rewriting the method; it works now
 - Created a data validation on the Podocyte from data imported on 1/2/2019; looks good

## KPMP-602, Blocked
 - Started data import and validation, but can't complete this ticket without gene expression tables

# 2019-01-03

## ATLAS DEMO NOTES
 - Cell Site
   - Refer to cards and fix missing cell type
 - Venn
   - Label colors and white outline are difficult to read
 - Data Table
   - Pre-populate the P Value with + to show the intersection of all sets
   - Sort the table by P Value on all sites in ascending order (0 first, 1 last)
   - Add download button and make it work
   - Add instructions above table for 1) how to sort, 2) how to filter, 3) sending feedback
 - Underlying Data
   - Validate where there are discrepant gene names by checking genes against available versions of human genomes (discrepant genes across versions may not be detectable)

## KPMP-566, Done
 - Release plan written; copies Delphinus release plan and iterates to include artifacts for Microscopium

## KPMP-558, Done
 - All nephron schematic art has already been implemented that I'm aware of, but more might be coming; I'm not sure
 - Marking blocked and assigning elsewhere until/if asset updates are received
 - Closing and covering this change under KPMP-607

## KPMP-559, Done/Won't Do
 - Same disposition as KPMP-558, so I'm handling it as a duplicate

## KPMP-607, Started/Blocked
 - Fix rollover behavior for macrophage, monocyte, and t-cell
 - Obtain arteriole art asset and implement with correct rollover
 - ... Added fix for interstitium, which was also missing (image is named and labeled 'fibroblast')
 - ... Done all except for the arteriole.  Will complete when I have access to Photoshop

## KPMP-565, Done
 - Add Download button; refer to comps
 - Can't refer to comps; link is down?
 - ... Built the button; included indicator with number of rows shown
 - Download now also works.  Used CSVLink component from react-csv library; it's not a great lib, has a vulnerability; should not keep beyond demo scope
