# NOTE HISTORY
# 2018-12-16

## INSTALLS
 - [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
   - [Tabular](https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular)
   - [Vim Markdown](https://github.com/gabrielelana/vim-markdown)
   - [Vim Markdown, Plasticboy](https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown) 

## NOTES
 - Getting more serious about using tmux and vim to structure my workflow today!
 - Needed the break to be selfish and compute **my wayyy~**
 - OK, Tabular looks gorgeous.  Vundle and Tabular are both installed now; :Tab/| should align:

## TABULAR TEST
| My        | name    | is    | mud     |
| My        | friends | don't | care    |
| When      | I       | go    | without |
| Underwear |
 
## MARKDOWN TEST
 - I'm less impressed with gabrielelana's vim-markdown highlighter; plasticboy seems to have
   a more subscribed one.
 - ... Switching in vundle...
 - So far the plasticboy version looks great.  I am just struggling with `C-i cr` for opening a newline versus just `o`.  I found a key mapping to jump to start or end of line while in insert mode, going to try that out now.
 - Perfect!  Adding new entries to this file is as simple as `G i C-e cr`. ... That must look insane to anyone who may read this.  Oh well.

## KPMP-530
 - Had to clean house on `kpmp-dvc2`; purged a bunch of old kernel update versions in `/boot` so I could install `zip` and upload to delphinus-dev
 - Transferred to dev.  Testing locally...
 - Wow, testing locally ended up being a pain.  I had to re-create the patients.json collection, generate UUIDs for each WSI, and all the format-munging involved.
 - This is exactly the kind of process that is tedious to do manually, tedious to script, but once scripted is magically automatic.  We need to get there badly.
 - Cleaning up my intermediate work in wsi-pipeline now...
 - Aaand done

## KPMP-554, Started
 - Venn Diagram component timebox
